            <h1>Our Story</h1>
            <p>
                Mama's Cakes all started with Theophile Vermeirsch (Theo) who was born in Antwerp in 1898. He first came
                to London with his family as refugees from Belgium in the First World War. During this time, he worked
                as a pastry chef. The family returned to Belgium some time in 1918 and in 1922 he married Esther Van
                Gyseghem, born in 1900 in Oostende. Together they returned to London and opened a Belgian patisserie in
                1926 on the corner of Dean Street and Old Compton Street in London’s Soho and called it "Patisserie
                Valerie”. Theo ran the bakery and Esther looked after the finances and front of house. Esther was fondly
                referred to as “Madame Valerie” by her customers.
            </p>
            <p>They were joined in the early thirties by Albert Joseph (Joe) Vermeirsch, Theo’s brother. He was born in
                London in 1915 and worked with Theo until he joined the British army at the start of the Second World
                War. In 1941 the patisserie was bombed but reopened in Old Compton Street soon after. Joe, returned to
                the bakery at the end of the war.
            </p>
            <p>
                Sadly, Theo died in 1947 and Esther continued to run the business with Joe and her brother, Albert van
                Gyseghem. They sold the patisserie in 1965 and Esther retired. She later died in 1975.
            </p>

                Fast forward nearly 100 years Patisserie Valerie now has 67 patisseries located throughout the UK, and a
                central bakery in Birmingham.
